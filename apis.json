			"description": "Azure Key Vault offers an easy, cost-effective way to safeguard keys and other secrets in the cloud by using hardware security modules (HSMs). Protect cryptographic keys and small secrets like passwords with keys stored in HSMs. For added assurance, import or generate your keys in HSMs that are certified to FIPS 140-2 level 2 and Common Criteria EAL4+ standards, so that your keys stay within the HSM boundary. Key Vault is designed so that Microsoft does not see or extract your keys. Create new keys for Dev-Test in minutes and migrate seamlessly to production keys managed by security operations. Key Vault scales to meet the demands of your cloud applications without the hassle required to provision, deploy, and manage HSMs and key management software.",
